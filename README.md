# Getting started with React

## Readme first

You have a few options when following this little tutorial series

1. Follow the approach outlined in the first video below, that will give you X branches you can checkout. So you'll get the code as it is at each step
2. Go though the branches here on github, see the videos and follow along
3. Go directly to the YouTube playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCx1FpZ4Dtb3a-x95O95G1vTV-puRWDuw and follow along from there, then you can use the repository to reference stuff.

The main thing is: React only becomes fun/exciting once you're up and running with the basics, so pay attention and choose one of the following learning strategies:

1. Monkey See - Monkey do. Although it might sound as an insult, IT IS NOT. Our brains learn stuff by typing it oursleves. So, follow the tutorial/instructions and make it work
2. Monkey See - Monkey Break Stuff. As above, but try to make it your own. Make a list of boybands instead of boring teachers.

There's a total of 65 minutes of video and a total of 65 lines of code.
